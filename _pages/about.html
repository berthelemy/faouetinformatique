    <blockquote>
        <p>"Mark is one of the best contractors I have ever worked with. If you need something delivered he's your man."
        </p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"Mark is a relatively new contact for me however he has impressed me very quickly with his detailed knowledge
            and
            passion for his subject. It is rare to find somebody so willing to give their own time, to share experience
            and
            knowledge freely. Mark could not be more personable or helpful."</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"Mark was fundamental to the success of our large Moodle upgrade project. He oversaw the key project aspects,
            including the project controls, requirements gathering and overall delivery. He was adept at bridging the
            gap
            between supplier and customer, minimising any conflict. Mark was able to offer a wider input into the
            project
            than his specific role from his years of experience in elearning. This was very valuable to us and helped us
            make some essential decisions very rapidly. Mark brings a pro-active, common-sense approach to all
            challenges
            and is able to articulate the most technical of issues to all audiences. If you want your elearning project
            to
            be a success speak to Mark!"</p>
