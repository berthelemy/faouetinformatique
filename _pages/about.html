<p>I've worked with information technology since the 1980s. It's something that I find natural and relatively painless. But I know that many people find technology difficult. My job is to help you over that pain.</p>

<p>I was a teacher (of children aged 5-18) for 7 years and then, for the past 20+ years worked in corporate learning and international development.</p>

<p>My base, near Le Faouët is a perfect central location to provide services into Morbihan, Finistère and Côtes-d'Armor.</p>

<p>I'm the editor, photographer and technician behind the <a href="https://nestledinbrittany.org.uk" target="_blank">Nestled in Brittany</a> website - a guide to some of my favourite places in our beautiful region.</p>
