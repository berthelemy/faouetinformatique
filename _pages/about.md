### Testimonials
    
> Mark designed our website for our campsite in France. It is easy to use and aesthetically pleasing. Customers can contact me and make bookings from the website. The website has 2 language options: French and English. Mark is always on hand for any upgrades and information changes. I have a blog that is attached to the website too. Our website does come up well on google and is one of the first ones. Mark makes having a website easy and takes the stress from me when having a busy business. We definitely get more traffic since Mark designed it. I would recommend Mark <b>Belinda Heaney - Camping Au Lac Du Drennec</b>
      
> On behalf of all the members in the group I just want to express their gratitude for the website designed by Mark Berthelemy for our community wind band group "The Belper Town Wind Band".  We have had many great responses with regard to future engagements and players who wish to join the band since the design of the site. We regard it as a valuable tool for recruitment and advertising the band. Mark provides a very professional service, and has been very quick to respond to any queries and updates required by the band or its committee. We are now very contactable because of the excellent design of our web pages. We would highly recommend Mark to anyone requiring a professionally managed website. <b>Ray Jones - Musical Director</b>
