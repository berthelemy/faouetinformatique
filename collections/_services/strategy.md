Work with me to answer your strategic questions around IT and communications:

- Are you investing in the right technologies?
- How are you addressing cybersecurity threats and data privacy concerns?
- Are you getting the best from your IT budget and your people?
- What is your disaster recovery and business continuity plan?
- How do your systems and processes help to attract and retain customers, and keep your costs to a minimum?
- How are you measuring success?
- What is your roadmap for developing your use of IT?

### How I work

My initial report will be based on:

- one or more workshops/conversations
- anything you can give me to read about your current IT situation
- an examination of your current external communications

The report will contain my analysis, recommendations, an approximate budget, and a high-level plan.

### Prices

Micro organisation (one or two employees/volunteers and fewer than 15 customers)
