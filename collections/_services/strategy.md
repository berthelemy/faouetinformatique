<p>Whilst your <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/services/websites">website</a> is the central point for people to find you, there are a number of other important aspects to clear, consistent communication:</p>

<ul>
    <li>An email address that reflects your website address, rather than using free email providers like gmail</li>
    <li>Automatic connections between your website and your Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram and other social media accounts</li>
    <li>Branded newsletters</li>
    <li>Letter and document templates that reflect your branding</li>
    <li>A means for customers to contact you, efficiently and securely</li>
</ul>
