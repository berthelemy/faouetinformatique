What is the first impression people get of your business or association when they search for you on the web?

- Can they find you?
- Do you have a website where they can find out about you?
- Does the site work on their mobile device?
- Does it load quickly?
- Can they find out what they need?
- Do they get in touch / buy something / join you?

If you answer no or don't know to any of these questions, then perhaps I can help!
